## Development Workflow


**4. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.
> Please open the following url `localhost:8080`


**5. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```

You can now deploy the contents of the `build` directory to production!
